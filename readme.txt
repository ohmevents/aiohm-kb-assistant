== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm not technical at all. Is this really for me? =

**Absolutely YES!** AIOHM was specifically designed for non-technical users. If you can write a blog post in WordPress, you can set up AIOHM. We have video tutorials for every step, and our support team helps hundreds of beginners every month.

= How much will the AI cost me monthly? =

Most small businesses pay **$5-15/month** for AI usage. Larger sites with lots of visitors might pay $20-50/month. You only pay for what you use, and you can set spending limits. The plugin itself is completely free.

= Will this sound like a robot? =

Not at all! AIOHM learns YOUR writing style and brand voice. After training, most people can't tell the difference between the AI responses and something you'd write yourself. It gets your personality, tone, and even your humor.

= What if it gives wrong answers? =

AIOHM only uses YOUR content to answer questions. It won't make up information or use outdated data from the internet. If it doesn't know something from your content, it will politely say so and suggest contacting you directly.

= Can I control what it knows? =

Yes, completely! You decide exactly what content the AI can access. Add or remove pages, posts, files, or specific information anytime. You can also create private knowledge that only you can access.

= Do I need coding skills? =

Zero coding required. Everything is point-and-click through your WordPress dashboard. The most "technical" thing you'll do is copy and paste a simple shortcode, which we walk you through step-by-step.

= Will this slow down my website? =

Not at all. The AI processing happens on external servers (OpenAI, Claude, etc.), not your website. Your site stays fast, and the chatbot loads quickly for visitors.

= Can I try it before committing? =

Yes! The plugin is free, and most AI providers offer free credits to start. You can test everything with minimal cost and see if it works for your business before scaling up.

= What if I get stuck? =

We have multiple support options:
- Video tutorials for visual learners
- Step-by-step written guides
- Live chat during business hours
- Email support for complex issues
- Community forum with other users

= Can this replace my customer support? =

It can handle 60-80% of common questions instantly, which means fewer emails and phone calls for you. For complex issues, it will smartly direct people to contact you directly. Think of it as a very smart first-line assistant.

= Will my customers like talking to AI? =

When done right (like with AIOHM), customers love it because they get instant answers instead of waiting for email responses. Since it uses your actual content and voice, many don't even realize they're talking to AI.
