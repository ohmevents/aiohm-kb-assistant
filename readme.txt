An emotionally intelligent assistant trained on your WordPress content. Use your own posts and pages to build a soulful, brand-aligned AI — powered by OpenAI.

== Description ==

**AIOHM KB Assistant** turns your WordPress website into a source of living knowledge.  
With a single click, convert your posts and pages into an internal knowledge base and connect it to OpenAI's GPT engine.  
Ask questions, get soulful answers, and give your visitors a truly aligned experience.

Perfect for:
- Coaches and creators
- Retreat and event sites
- Conscious brands with a message

== Features ==
* Select any post type to include in your assistant
* Generate a clean JSON knowledge base (no tech needed)
* Use a simple shortcode to place a branded AI on your site
* Ask natural questions and get responses from GPT-3.5
* Enter your OpenAI API key securely via plugin settings
* Built for alignment, simplicity, and brand clarity

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin via the Plugins menu
3. Go to **AIOHM Assistant** settings in your admin panel
4. Select which content to use and click **Generate KB**
5. Add your OpenAI API key
6. Place `[aiohm_kb_assistant]` on any page or post

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is my content sent to OpenAI? =  
Only the specific post or page that matches a user query is sent — and only if you’ve entered your API key.

= Can I use this without OpenAI? =  
Yes. Without an API key, the assistant will fall back to direct content matching and display local info.

= Will this slow down my site? =  
No. The plugin runs a clean sync and serves lightweight responses only when queried.
