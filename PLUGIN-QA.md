## üéØ **Plugin Functionality & Problem Solving**

### **Q: What specific problems does AIOHM Knowledge Assistant solve for WordPress users?**

**A:** The AIOHM KB Assistant plugin empowers your website with a voice-aligned AI assistant that reflects your brand's essence. Its standout feature is a dual-mode Knowledge Base system, Public and Private, that no other plugin offers. Public mode powers a customer-facing assistant trained on your approved content. Private mode supports your creative flow with Muse, drawing from confidential documents and training material hidden from public access. Designed for coaches, facilitators, and conscious brands, AIOHM connects your content to a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine, creating an assistant deeply aware of your unique knowledge structure.

** Here are the core problems it solves:**

**IMMEDIATE PAIN POINTS:**
- **Support Email Overload**: Businesses get 50-200+ emails daily asking the same questions
- **24/7 Availability Gap**: Customers need help outside business hours but get no response
- **Inconsistent Responses**: Different team members give different answers to the same questions
- **Content Creation Burnout**: Spending hours writing emails, social posts, and content that sounds "off-brand"
